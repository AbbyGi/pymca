VERSION 4.2.2

- Input/Output: Support CSV format.
  This should simplify data exchange with spreadsheets.

- Input/Output: Support 64-bit handling of EDF files.

- ScanWindow: Possibility to save all curves in a single specfile.

- McaWindow: Spectra are saved with the active calibration instead of its own.
  In other words: what you see is what you get.

- Possibility to rename graph curves.

- Possibility to save single images thru matplotlib.
  This allows user customization (axes, colorbar, colormap, contours, ...)

- ROI imaging: Use file-mapped arrays for stacks of more than 2 Gbytes.
  This feature is implemented for 64-bit linux systems.

- McaAdvancedFit: The combination of linear fit and fixed pile-up was buggy.

- Calibration: Correct a crash under python 2.5 using the Auto FWHM option. 

- RGB Correlator: ASCII images saved under windows can be read under linux.

- Some other minor bugs corrected and some other minor features added.

VERSION 4.2.1

- ROI image: Possibility to normalize spectra to number of pixels.

- Speed up access to specfiles containing many scans.

- Correct a bug that was making the calculation of net ROI images useless.

- Correct ESRF specific data acquisition monitoring problems.

VERSION 4.2.0

- ROI Imaging Tool: Possibility to calculate net ROI images.

- ROI Imaging Tool: Minimum width was a problem on dual screen displays.

- ROI Imaging Tool: When using two stacks, the colormaps where coupled.

- Main MCA Window old ROI markers were not erased under some conditions.

VERSION 4.1.1

- ROI Tool: Possibility to handle two stacks of same size simultaneously.
  The interest is to combine fluorescence and diffraction maps.

- Possibility to save ROI configuration directly from the table.

- ROI Tool: Stack background removal implemented.
  It may be of interest on diffraction maps. It is very slow and not worth
  for fluorescence maps. The advanced fit is much better in this later case.

- Linux: Add pymcaroitool to the binary package.
  The ROI Tool can be started as an independent application and not only from
  within PyMca.

- Corrected: Simple fit combined with an energy calibration works.

- Corrected: Scan monitoring. Last scan point was not shown.

after changing the concentration parameters without passing thru the
fit configuration window could be different from those shown on the 
screen.

VERSION 4.0.9

- Concentration calculated on batch mode were wrong if the fundamental
parameter method was employed and no report was generated. This bug was
introduced in version 4.0.2

- Batches were unable to start if the first file had a name with
more characters than the last one.

- Solved a random crash when showing the fit configuration dialog.

- Program was unable to start under Python 2.5

- Possibility to set anchors to the strip background. This makes the 
strip background the ideal choice when the spectra present background 
pile up artifacts.

VERSION 4.0.8

- Upgraded underlying sip and PyQt libraries.

- Scan window operational.

  like using remote desktop, hiding the windows taskbar or 
  when the screensaver was activated.

- Several minor bugs fixed.

VERSION 4.0.6

- Solve a printing issue on some systems.
  A black square was always present at the lower right corner.

- Started to add functionalities to the scan window.

VERSION 4.0.5

- Improvements in the RGB Correlator/Post Batch tool:
  Read new images.
  Perform mathematical operations with the images.

- Solve a file format identification problem.
  Some EDF files where wrongly identified as specfile.

- Correct a bug reading specfile formatted files. 
  In case of multiple scans, only the mca(s) of the first scan were read.

- Correct a bug in the ROI imaging tool. 
  If the first channel was different from 0, there was an offset in each ROI.

- Windows: Correct a bug making the applications crash on startup.

- Speed up fit configuration dialog. It was awfully slow since version 3.9.4 Qt4.

- Linux: Matplotlib saving of graphics working in the binary release also under (K)Ubuntu.
  (It was already the case in pymca4.0.2-linux-p1.tgz)

VERSION 4.0.2

- Allow the user to choose if the data have to be weighted during the fit.

- Correct a bug only affecting linear batches: areas and concentrations were smaller by
a factor 10000. The bug was introduced in version 4.0.0

- Faster concentrations calculation.

- Concentrations calculated on batches do not force the generation of the .fit files.

- Linux: sps library made locale independent.

VERSION 4.0.1

- Plotting under windows should be faster.

- Solved a small memory leak usign the strip background.

- Advanced fit config button reported not to work on a gentoo 64-bit system when building PyMCA from source. Corrected.

  After a fit, you can load the non-linear parameters from last fit into the configuration just by pressing a button.

- Huge speed up of pure imaging batches (specially linear fits).

- Possibility to save the imaging tool generated images in ASCII and EDF formats besides pure graphical formats.

- Display (X, Y, Z) coordenates in EDF viewers.

- Mark selected peaks in fit window, not in the main McaWindow.

- The windows installation allows to keep the old 3.9.4 version (ESRF)installed. 
  That windows version can be downloaded from the ESRF. It has less features but a faster interface.

  The peak selection buttons were not coloured under some windows theme configurations.


VERSION 3.9.4 Qt4

- Publication quality graphics thru matplotlib. 
  The packages are so big in part because of matplotlib.

- Qt4 support. I will drop Qt3 in future releases.
  Latest windows versions now available from sourceforge and not from the ESRF.

- Universal support for Mac.

- Started to add imaging tools (ESRF Data Format file stacks for the time being).

  This tool is to be used after a batch (Qt4 only).
  It can be used with previous batch results.

- The default short tail slope is set to 0.5

- The peaks tailing information was missing in the HTML Report. It should be there now.

- It exposes all the theoretical shell constants in ASCII files. 
  This allows the end user to customize the theoretical values by editing the relevant files:
         KShellRates.dat
         KShellConstants.dat
         LShellRates.dat
         LShellConstants.dat
         MShellRates.dat

  Problem was due to a bad transcription of the used theoretical data.

- The elements info shows energy dependent L and M ratios.
  Nothing changes for the fit. Just the information is shown.
