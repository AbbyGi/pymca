This is the MIT version of the PyMca XRF Toolkit.
Please read the LICENSE file to know what that means.

INSTALLATION

I remind you that ready-to-use packages are available for the most
common platforms. Please keep going if you want to build the code from
source.

If you want to build from a github checkout, you will need cython installed
on your system. If you use a source distribution, the generated code should
be already there.

Examples of use:

1 - Install everything in default directories (typical for windows users or system
administrators):

python setup.py install

2 - Install to specific destinations (typical for posix systems):

python setup.py install --install-scripts SCRIPTS_DIRECTORY
python setup.py install --install-lib DESTINATION_DIRECTORY
python setup.py install --install-lib DESTINATION_DIRECTORY --install-scripts SCRIPTS_DIRECTORY

The directories have to be specified with their full path without the last "/".

In any case you need write privileges to the final directories.

3 - Creation of an easy to install windows binary using Visual Studio

python setup.py bdist_wininst --install-script pymca_win_post_install.py 

4 - Creation of an easy to install windows binary using the  MinGW compiler
python setup.py build -c mingw32
python setup.py bdist_wininst --skip-build --install-script pymca_win_post_install.py

You will need:

- Python (> 2.6 recommended)

- Numpy

If you want to use the graphical interfaces provided, you will need a running
python installation with:

- PyQt4 + matplotlib (PyMca license will be GPL unless you have a commercial PyQt4 license)
- PySide + matplotlib (PyMca license will be MIT because PySide is LGPL)

If you want to embed PyMca in your own graphical applications, I recommend you to use
the McaAdvancedFit.py module. It is very easy to embed.

DEVELOPMENT PLANS

- Port all Physics to C++

- Include analytical secondary excitation corrections in multilayers.

- Compound fitting.

If you have any questions or comments (or contributions!), please feel free to
contact me.

Enjoy,
